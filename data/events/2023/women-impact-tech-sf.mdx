  Panel: The Importance of Cutting-Edge Security and How To Combat Data Breaches
</a> w/ Maya Kaczorowski

Organizations that fail to effectively secure their valuable data expose themselves to significant risks such as reputational damage and operational interruptions. The remediation costs alone can cost a fortune because security personnel is typically hired to identify how the breach occurred, then how to close security gaps and determine the extent of the damage occurs. In this panel, we will discuss cloud security and managing visibility, accessibility, and risk. We hope you take away some key pieces of advice that can protect yourself from having information stolen.

Main Stage @ 11:30 on Wednesday
